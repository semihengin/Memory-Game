# Memory Game

This project is a memory game developed using C#. The goal is to challenge players' memory skills by matching pairs of cards. It is designed as a simple yet engaging game to test and improve short-term memory capabilities.

Note: This project was developed in April 2021 during my first year of university as an early programming exercise to improve my C# skills and understand fundamental game development concepts.

## Game Rules

- **Flipping Cards**: Players flip two cards at a time to find matching pairs.
- **Matching**: If the two selected cards match, they remain open; otherwise, they are turned back over.
- **Objective**: Match all card pairs in the shortest time and with the fewest moves.
- **Game Completion**: The game ends when all pairs are successfully matched, and the player's performance is recorded.

## Features
